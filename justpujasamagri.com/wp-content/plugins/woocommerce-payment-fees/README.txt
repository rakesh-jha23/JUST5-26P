A WooCommerce Extension that allow to add additional fees to your payment gateways.

== Description ==

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

This extension will add new section in each WooCommerce Payment Gateway that will allow you to add additional fees to your gateways. It's useful for COD payment gateway, in example, since WooCommerce does not allow this by default.
You can change quickly the fee in the admin panel too, for each order. Also you can choose how to handle taxes on the payment fee or exclude them automatically.

This plugin was tested with the following gateways

* BACS (included in WooCommerce)
* Cheque  (included in WooCommerce)
* COD (included in WooCommerce)
* PayPal  (included in WooCommerce)
* [WooCommerce CardSave Redirect Gateway](http://www.cardsave.net/)
* [WooCommerce PagSeguro](https://github.com/claudiosmweb/woocommerce-pagseguro)
* [WooCommerce Cash on Pickup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-cash-on-pickup/)
* [WooCommerce PostePay](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-postepay/)

If you are using a different gateway and have problems, please let us know which one you are using and we will do our best to support it too!
